# student-average-calculator
A simple Python project that asks for a studentâ€™s grades, computes the average, and shows if the student passed or failed.

This is a simple Python program that calculates the **general average** of a student based on 7 subjects:

- Math  
- Science  
- P.E.  
- A.P.  
- English  
- Filipino  
- Hekasi  

The program will:
1. Ask for the student's name.  
2. Accept grades for each subject.  
3. Compute the average grade.  
4. Display the student's name, the grading title (**"1ST OR 2ND GRADING QUARTER ONE"**), the computed average, and remarks (Passed/Failed).
